    adjective = random.choice(adjectives)
    animal = random.choice(animals)

    cute_animal_name = adjective + ' ' + animal

    return cute_animal_name

# Example usage
name = generate_cute_animal_name()
print("Your cute animal name is:", name)
```

This code uses the `random` module to randomly select an adjective and an animal from predefined lists. It then combines the selected adjective and animal to form a cute animal name. Finally, it returns the generated name and prints it to the console.

Feel free to try it out and see what cute animal name you get!
