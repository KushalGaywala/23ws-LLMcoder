Describe code, either directly or in a Python comment. In this case, you should implement the described code.\n2. Write incomplete code. In this case, you should complete the code from the last cursor position.\n3. If the last character is a newline or tab, come up with one or more possible next lines of code.\n\n\n## Example 1:\n\n[INPUT]\n# Function that adds two numbers\ndef\n[/INPUT]\n\n[ANSWER]\n```python\n add_numbers(a, b):\n    return a + b\n```\n[/ANSWER]\n\n\n## Example 2:\n\n[INPUT]\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    # Computes the fact\n```\n[/INPUT]\n\n[ANSWER]\n```python\n    # Computes the factorial of a number\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\n```\n[/ANSWER]\n\n\n## Example 3:\n\n[INPUT]\nI need a function that checks if a number is prime\n[/INPUT]\n\n[ANSWER]\n```python\ndef is_prime(number):\n    if number > 1:\n        for i in range(2, int(number**0.5)+1):\n            if (number % i) == 0:\n                return False\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n```\n[/ANSWER]\n\n\n# Rules:\n- Your entire response must be valid Python code.\n- Avoid evasive or incomplete answers.\n- Any comments or notes must be made in Python code block, i.e., ```python ... ```.\n- You must not add any additional comments or notes outside of the ```python ... ``` blocks. Your entire response must only consist of one Python code block.\n- You must end your response after ending the Python code block with \"```\".\n"

The `visited` list is used to keep track of the nodes that have been visited, and the `stack` is used to keep track of nodes to explore. The code iteratively pops nodes from the stack, checks if they have been visited, and adds them to the visited list if not. Then, for each neighbor of the current node, it adds the neighbor to the stack for further exploration.\n\nNote: Make sure to provide a valid `graph` parameter (i.e., a dictionary representing the graph) and a valid `start` parameter."
