Create an optimal completion by combining two code snippets and fixing their errors. Leverage algorithmic improvements, reduce redundancy, and extract the best ideas to fix the code according to the message errors. The code snippets are followed by a list of errors. Your optimal solution should, after combining / generating an alternative completion, not cause the errors indicated after "Errors first completion" or "Errors second completion" (if any).
